# Skill: git-commits

Cursor skill for **commit messages** and **branch flow**: file grouping, Conventional Commits format, and checkout/stash/push workflow for feature branches.

## When to use

- Writing or reviewing commit messages.
- Deciding how to group files into commits.
- Switching branch while carrying changes (stash → checkout → pop → commit → push).
- Following repository commit rules.

## Main content (SKILL.md)

- Ask commit language (EN or other) and, when in doubt, ask before acting.
- Grouping guideline (focus per commit; file count subjective).
- Format: `type[(scope)]: description` + bullet body.
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, ci, build, chore.
- Good and bad examples.
- Workflow: stash → checkout → pop → commit → push for feature branch.
- Pre-commit checklist.
